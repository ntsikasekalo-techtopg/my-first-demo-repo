#my-first-demo-repo

this is my first ever repo make on the: 15 December 2022
on the: 26 December I updated this repo in order to practice how to push files into a repo 

##The file that will be pushed is a project that I did. 

It is an html + css file of a webpage for me that i made in an hour or so, 
It's nothing special but I felt proud when I made it as it showed the little progess I had made
in my web development journey.

Keep in my I had started learning web dev in December of 2022 

LOL, i don't even know how to push a file but I'm basically about to google it & do it

WISH ME LUCK ;)
